      Hi! My name is Aidan Heller. This year, I joined a Creative Writing class
      at <a href="https://sehs.4j.lane.edu/">South Eugene High School</a> in order
      to become a better at writing. I'm not really aspiring to be a writer, but I find
      making my ideas come to life to be enjoyable. Since you're here, you might want to visit
      my fiction, poetry, or non-fiction.
