            I was just chilling with my girl Lee<br/>
            We were watching SNL on the TV<br/>
            While we were watching, well, you see,<br/>
            I said one of the actors was pretty
          </p>
          <p>
            I took a wrong turn<br/>
            I wanna go back<br/>
            But can’t fix it now<br/>
            The past is the past<br/>
          </p>
          <p>
            Was headed to the bar with my man Dan<br/>
            He stopped to use the bathroom for a second, and,<br/>
            I flirted a little with his girlfriend, Ann,<br/>
            Now I’m no longer his… friand.
          </p>
          <p>
            I took a wrong turn<br/>
            I wanna go back<br/>
            But can’t fix it now<br/>
            The past is the past
          </p>
          <p>
            At the bar on a Saturday night<br/>
            Get a little drunk, get in a fight<br/>
            Jab a guy in the throat with a knife<br/>
            Now it's too late to make things right
          </p>
          <p>
            I took a wrong turn<br/>
            I wanna go back<br/>
            But can’t fix it now<br/>
            The past is the past
          </p>
