          The sky was dark. Though it did not feel like night, because I was wide awake. I was standing on what seemed
          like a gigantic ferry bridge, perhaps fifty meters wide. I stood among a crowd of thousands of people, and I
          could tell by their quiet murmuring that they were just as confused as I was. I guessed that it was no use
          to ask someone where we were, but I decided to give it a shot anyway. I tapped the shoulder of the man next
          to me and sayed, “Sir? Hello, Sir? Do you know where we are?” The man gave me a blank stare and shook his
          head. <i>I wonder where we are?</i>
        </div>
        <div className="ind">
          Suddenly, as if to answer my question, a cheery women came on the loudspeaker and said, “Hi there, humans!
          You’ve just arrived in the afterlife. Please wait your turn to check in with the receptionist. That’s me!”
          <i>The afterlife? If this is the afterlife then I must be dead.</i> I decided to believe the voice, because I had
          nothing better to go by. It was a very strange situation indeed.
        </div>
        <div className="ind">
          It felt like ages before I reached the front of the line. I walked into a massive metal building at the end
          of the bridge. The building felt empty and oddly quiet. It had several couches, and lounging on them were
          two huge, bulky men. I approached one of the desks. There was a woman standing behind it, and I assumed she
          was the receptionist. Before I could say anything, she started talking in a cheery voice.
        </div>
        <div className="ind">
          “Hi there! Welcome to the afterlife. How are you on this wonderful day?”
        </div>
        <div className="ind">
          “Umm… good, I guess. Hey, can you tell me what’s going on? Am I really dead?”
        </div>
        <div className="ind">
          “Sure are,” she chirped, “you’re as dead as dead gets!” She giggled as if that was some hilarious joke.
        </div>
        <div>
          “Ok… well, what now? Do I go to heaven or something?”
        </div>
        <div className="ind">
          “Well,” she said as she began going through her desk, “I’ll need to look at your files. Let's see… oh dear.
          It looks like you were a gang leader. You stole from anyone and everyone, and even murdered. I’m afraid it’s
          straight to hell with you.”
        </div>
        <div className="ind">
          “Now hold on,” I objected, “I don’t remember any of that!”
        </div>
        <div className="ind">
          “Perfectly normal,” she said as she smiled an uncanny smile, “Humans hardly ever remember their lives! Well,
          goodbye!”
        </div>
        <div className="ind">
          She snapped her fingers and the two men on the couch rose and began approaching me. They were much larger
          when they stood up. Before I could escape, they seized me, one arm each, and dragged me into a room. The
          door shut, and I was locked in.
        </div>
        <div className="ind">
          The room was an elevator, and it began moving down. I did not know where it was going, but the receptionist
          did say I was going to hell. Did she also say I was a gang leader? How could it be possible that I did not
          remember anything? I decided to ask a question to the guards. “Hey,” I sayed, “Where are we going? I don’t
          remember being a gang leader.” The guards said nothing, and continued to keep a straight face.
        </div>
        <div className="ind">
          Perhaps a few minutes later, the elevator slowed to a stop. The door opened, and I saw… something that I did
          not expect to see. There was a ravine, and in it was a beautiful field of flowers, filled with a rainbow of
          colors. The sweet scents filled my nostrils like honey. It might as well have been heaven, or at least, for
          anyone else. Not me, though. I was deadly allergic to pollen.
        </div>
        <div className="ind">
          “Wait,” I panicked, “I’m allergic to pollen! I can’t! Besides, I wasn’t a gang leader! I’m certain!” The men
          were silent. “Listen to me! I’m innocent!” They picked me up, as if they were going to take me back up. At
          least that’s what I thought before they threw me over the edge.
        </div>
        <div className="ind">
          <i>This is the worst thing that could happen</i>, I thought. It was my worst nightmare. While my nostrils
          burned with the heat of 1000 degrees, my whole life flashed before my eyes. I saw myself talking with a
          group of men, perhaps my friends. I saw myself speeding down a city street, with sirens screaming close
          behind. And then, I killed someone. I didn't know who, but someone was dead because of me. I was a gang
          leader. There was no mistake.
        </div>
        <div className="ind">
          The torture went on for an eternity, and I deserved it. I was a murderer, after all. Then as the burning
          began to mellow down, I assumed I was getting used to it. But that was not the case. The pain really was
          mellowing, and I was being pulled up the ravine with a rope. I looked down. The flowers below glared as if
          I should not have escaped, and I couldn’t have agreed more. I was a killer in my past life. I needed hell.
        </div>
        <div className="ind">
          When I got up, I looked up at my savior. It was the confused man from the line, but my newfound memories
          told me he was my brother. He was holding what looked like a small handgun, but clearly it was not because
          it had frozen the guards in gigantic crystals.
        </div>
        <div className="ind">
          “Hi there,” he said, “you’re being rescued. Come with me.”
        </div>
        <div className="ind">
          I was completely speechless. It seemed like my brother could not remember who I was. I managed to stutter,
          “How… how did you get that? And how did you find me?”
        </div>
        <div className="ind">
          “Oh this old thing? Well, when they told me I was going to hell, I thought fast. I dived behind the
          receptionists desk and found this handgun, which looks like it can freeze anything in diamonds. Then, I took
          the quickest way out, which just so happened to be this elevator. You know, this whole place isn’t very
          secure.”
        </div>
        <div className="ind">
          “Well, what are you waiting for? Come with me!” he said.
        </div>
        <div className="ind">
          I knew what I had to do, though. I needed to repent. I started backing towards the ravine. “I’m sorry,” I
          said, as I walked backwards. “I need to. I was a bad person.”
        </div>
        <div className="ind">
          “Wait! Don’t!” cried my brother, but it was too late. I fell into the flower field of torture to experience
          eternal pain. Perhaps someday I could have a new life.
