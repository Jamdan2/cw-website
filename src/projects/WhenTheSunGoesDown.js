          <p>
            The sun went down in the little town<br/>
            And shops started closing all around<br/>
            All the salespeople gave a frown<br/>
            Shops never open when the sun goes down.
          </p>
          <p>
            Everyone began to hurry around<br/>
            Salespeople, bakers, artists and clowns<br/>
            Their quick footsteps were the only sound<br/>
            They did not want to be out when the sun went down
          </p>
          <p>
            All the ladies put on their nightgowns<br/>
            All the children in their beds laid down<br/>
            All were in the home they called their oughne<br/>
            Because who knows what comes out when the sun goes down?
          </p>
          <p>
            It could be a monster!<br/>
            A pack of wolves<br/>
            Maybe a madman<br/>
            Or some horrible ghouls
          </p>
          <p>
            Why go out there?<br/>
            There's nothing to gain<br/>
            If we just stay inside<br/>
            Weâ€™ll all be okay
          </p>
          <p>
            The little boy stood alone in the town<br/>
            All was quiet; there was not a sound<br/>
            He went out that night and that's when he found<br/>
            That the stars come out when the sun goes down
          </p>
